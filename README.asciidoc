Wslay - WebSocket library
=========================

Wslay is a WebSocket library written in C. The supported protocol is
version 13 described in RFC6455.  This library offers 2 levels API:
event-based API and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it
is suitable for non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set
callbacks in various events. For frame-based API, you can send
WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only supports data transfer part of
WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening handshake in HTTP.

Wslay supports:

 * Text/Binary messages.
 * Automatic ping reply.
 * Callback interface.
 * External event loop.

Wslay does not perform any I/O operations for its own. Instead, it
offers callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any I/O
frameworks, SSL, sockets, etc.  This makes Wslay protable across
various platforms and the application authors can choose freely IO
frameworks.
