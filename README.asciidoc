Wslay - WebSocket library
=========================

Wslay is a WebSocket library. The supported protocol is version 13
described in RFC6455.  This library offers 2 levels API: message-based
and frame-based API.  For message-based API, it is suitable for
non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set callbacks in various
events.  For frame-based API, you can send WebSocket frame directly.

Wslay supports:

 * Text/Binary messages.
 * Automatic ping reply.
 * Callback interface.
 * External event loop.

Wslay does not do IO operations for its own. Instead, it offers
callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any IO frameworks,
SSL, sockets, etc.  This makes Wslay protable across various platforms
and the application authors can choose freely IO frameworks.
