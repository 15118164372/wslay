Wslay - Low-level WebSocket framing library
===========================================

Wslay is a WebSocket framing library. The protocol is based on
RFC6455. This library only does data framing: send frame and receive
frame.  It does several protocol violation checks, such as fragmented
control frame. If you are looking for near complete WebSocket library,
this is not for you. This libaray serves you well if you intend to
create complete WebSocket libarary and use this libaray as a data
framing layer. Actually Wslay is created for this purpose.

Wslay does not:

 * Checks UTF8 sequence.
 * Checks interleaved text/binary frames.
 * Checks proper use of fin bit.
 * Replay ping automatically.

Wslay provides callbacks for actual data read/write, so that the user
code can use this library for any kind of data source and output sink.
